# Playwright Vision AI

Transforms Playwright test debugging with AI-powered visual analysis.

## What It Is

Playwright Vision captures screenshots, HTML, and error details when tests fail, then uses AI models to visually analyze what went wrong and suggest fixes.

## Key Features

1. **Visual Element Detection**: Identifies UI elements in screenshots
2. **Smart Selector Recommendations**: Suggests better selectors following Playwright best practices
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Explains why your tests failed in plain language
4. **Markdown-Formatted Results**: Integrates cleanly into your test reports
5. **Token Optimization**: Cleans HTML to reduce token usage and minimize API costs

## Implementation Highlights

The main components:
- A test base extension that captures context on failure
- Integration with Google's Generative AI
- Clean error presentation with formatted boxes
- HTML optimization to reduce token usage and API costs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or higher
- Playwright Test setup
- Google Gemini API key

### Configuration

1. Get a Google Gemini API key from the [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)
2. Add your API key to the `aiDebugger.ts` file or use environment variables

### Usage

Replace your Playwright test imports with the AI-enhanced version:

```typescript
// Instead of this:
// import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

// Use this:
import { test, expect } from './ai-test-base';

// Write tests as normal
test('my test', async ({ page }) => {
  // Your test code
});
```

When a test fails, the AI overlay will:
1. Capture a screenshot and HTML
2. Clean HTML to reduce token usage
3. Send the optimized context to Gemini AI
4. Add detailed analysis to your test report

## Example Output

When a test fails, you'll see detailed AI analysis in your test report:

```
### üéØ Element Identification
The test was trying to interact with an API link in the navigation menu, which appears in the top part of the page.

### ‚ú® Suggested Locators
1. **User-Facing:** `page.getByRole('link', { name: 'API' })`
2. **CSS:** `page.locator('nav >> text=API')`
3. **XPath:** `page.locator('//a[contains(text(),"API")]')`

### ‚ùì Failure Explanation
The element might not have been visible within the timeout period (3000ms). This could be due to page loading time, animation effects, or the element being located in a dropdown that needs to be opened first.
